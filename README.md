Steps 1:
Obtaining dataset from the DENUE API containing all stores selling beer, wine, cigarettes, non-alcoholic drinks, and ice in Nuevo Leon, Monterrey.

Obtaining dataset from the INUE containing all of the AGEBs, their population, along with several other variables for Nuevo Leon, Monterrey.

Obtaining dataset with information about Municipalities in Monterrey to use as a catalog for the municipalities.

Steps 2:
Performing exploratory data analysis of all datasets in Python to familiarize with the data and to identify key relationships between the data. 

Standardizing key variables (Municipalities and Agebs) to be able to make connections and relate the data in Tableau.

Make connections between the 3 tables in Tableau.

Dashboard contains the following visualizations:
Heat map showcasing the location of stores as well as people per store by Ageb aiming to help identify potential stores with higher traffic
Bar chart showcasing people per store by Ageb aiming to help identify how people per store is distributed by Ageb
Data table showcasing number of stores, population, and people per store by Ageb aiming to show some numbers that are shown in the previous two visualizations
Pie chart showcasing the distribution of stores by municipality
